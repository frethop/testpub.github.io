Lord,

We lift your name high today and we offer you our praise this morning.  We praise your grace, your patience, your neverending kindness to us.  Lord, we celebrate your love.    

We pray for our world this morning.  We pray for peace in Ukraine, for peace in the Middle East, for peace in the United States, for peace for peace for peace.  We thank you for the joy we experience: for money raised by Dance Marathon at Hope College, for peer-to-peer bowling at Holland West, for love shown when someone buys coffee for someone else. 

Thank you for the gift of worship here at Faith Church.  Thank you for the simple act of coming together to praise you, the blessing of offering songs and talents and resources to you, the ways we show we care.  Thanks for the people in this church who pray for those in need, for those who send cards, who give hugs, who encourage, who ask. Thanks for the staff and for Pastor Chad and Pastor Jen and Pastor Enrique.   

Lord, suffering is all around us.  Remember those who are hungry, who suffer from gun violence, who are sick and can’t get well. Bless those who suffer in silence, those with pain and mental illness, those who are lonely. 

We pray for healing in this congregation.  Please grant healing to Clay Slenk and others in our congregation who suffer.  Grant patience and perseverance we pray.

Thanks for the opportunities to serve you, to give time and resources to you.  Please take our service, however it is, and accept as love for you. 

During this Lent time, we ask for time and space in our lives to live in Lent.  Help us to see you, to wrestle with Christ’s sacrifice.  Help us to put sin to death and bless us with contentment today.

Lord, we know you are here.  We know you know how we feel and what we need and what our souls crave before we do.  Help us to trust you especially when we don’t understand you.  

Amen.
